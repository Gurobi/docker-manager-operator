# What is `gurobi/manager-operator`?

We introduced a Kubernetes Autoscaler Operator for Gurobi Compute Servers that provides configurable autoscaling to align the number of pods in a cluster to the current workload. The operator monitors job queues, waiting times, and node utilization, and adjusts deployments up or down as needed. Scale-down is handled gracefully to avoid interrupting running jobs.
The scaling logic can be modified through parameters, giving users control over how decisions are made. The operator is published on DockerHub and uses the existing Cluster Manager REST APIs, ensuring backwards compatibility with previous Gurobi Compute Server versions.

For detailed information, please refer to the [Gurobi Operator documentation](https://github.com/Gurobi/docker-manager-operator/blob/main/reference.md).
